      "I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the Army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as assistant surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.\n",
      "The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\n",
      "Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the veranda, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was despatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\n",
      "I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air-or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.\n",
      "On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.\n",
      "\"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\" he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. \"You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\"\n",
      "I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.\n",
      "\"Poor devil!\" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. \"What are you up to now?\"\n",
      "\"Looking for lodgings,\" I answered. \"Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\"\n",
      "\"That's a strange thing,\" remarked my companion; \"you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.\"\n",
      "\"And who was the first?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.\"\n",
      "\"By Jove!\" I cried; \"if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.\"\n",
      "Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass. \"You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,\" he said; \"perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.\"\n",
      "\"Why, what is there against him?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.\"\n",
      "\"A medical student, I suppose?\" said I.\n",
      "\"No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the-way knowledge which would astonish his professors.\"\n",
      "\"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\"\n",
      "\"I should like to meet him,\" I said. \"If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?\"\n",
      "\"He is sure to be at the laboratory,\" returned my companion. \"He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning till night. If you like, we will drive round together after luncheon.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.\n",
      "As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.\n",
      "\"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,\" he said; \"I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.\"\n",
      "\"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,\" I answered. \"It seems to me, Stamford,\" I added, looking hard at my companion, \"that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealymouthed about it.\"\n",
      "\"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\" he answered with a laugh. \"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.\"\n",
      "\"Very right too.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.\"\n",
      "\"Beating the subjects!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.\"\n",
      "\"And yet you say he is not a medical student?\"\n",
      "\"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\" As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the farther end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\n",
      "This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\n",
      "Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I've found it! I've found it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\n",
      "\"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.\n",
      "\"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.\"\n",
      "\"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is about haemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?\"\n",
      "\"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but practically-- --\"\n",
      "\"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains? Come over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \"Let us have some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\n",
      "\"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"\n",
      "\"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"Beautiful! beautiful! The old guaiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" I murmured.\n",
      "\"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes's test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\"\n",
      "His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.\n",
      "\"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.\n",
      "\"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.\"\n",
      "\"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a laugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police News of the Past.'\"\n",
      "\"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. \"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a smile, \"for I dabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\n",
      "\"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings; and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.\"\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?\"\n",
      "\"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\"\n",
      "\"By no means.\"\n",
      "\"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings? I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\"\n",
      "I laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said, \"and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.\"\n",
      "\"Do you include violin playing in your category of rows?\" he asked, anxiously.\n",
      "\"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a treat for the gods--a badly played one-- --\"\n",
      "\"Oh, that's all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.\"\n",
      "\"When shall we see them?\"\n",
      "\"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle everything,\" he answered.\n",
      "\"All right--noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.\n",
      "We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.\n",
      "\"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \"how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"\n",
      "My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That's just his little peculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very piquant.\n",
      "I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study of mankind is man,' you know.\"\n",
      "\"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. \"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Good-bye.\"\n",
      "\"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.\n",
      "They consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.\n",
      "Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\n",
      "As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\n",
      "The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\n",
      "He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.\n",
      "His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to me to be such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\n",
      "\"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"\n",
      "\"To forget it!\"\n",
      "\"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\"\n",
      "\"But the Solar System!\" I protested.\n",
      "\"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently: \"you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"\n",
      "I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way:\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes--his limits:\n",
      "Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.\n",
      "Philosophy.--Nil.\n",
      "Astronomy.--Nil.\n",
      "Politics.--Feeble.\n",
      "Botany.--Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\n",
      "Knowledge of Geology.--Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them.\n",
      "Knowledge of Chemistry.--Profound.\n",
      "Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.\n",
      "Sensational Literature.--Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.\n",
      "Plays the violin well.\n",
      "Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\n",
      "Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\n",
      "When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. \"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\" I said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"\n",
      "I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his armchair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy, was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\n",
      "During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow, rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow, who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a gray-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew peddler, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another, a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bedroom. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \"I have to use this room as a place of business,\" he said, \"and these people are my clients.\" Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point-blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.\n",
      "It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\n",
      "Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\n",
      "\"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boots, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuffs --by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"\n",
      "\"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table; \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"\n",
      "\"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my eggspoon as I sat down to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me, though. It is evidently the theory of some armchair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third-class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\"\n",
      "\"You would lose your money,\" Holmes remarked calmly. \"As for the article, I wrote it myself.\"\n",
      "\"You!\"\n",
      "\"Yes; I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical, are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\"\n",
      "\"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.\n",
      "\"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault, they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\"\n",
      "\"And these other people?\"\n",
      "\"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.\"\n",
      "\"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\"\n",
      "\"You were told, no doubt.\"\n",
      "\"Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\"\n",
      "\"It is simple enough as you explain it,\" I said, smiling. \"You remind me of Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.\"\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \"No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\" he observed. \"Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\"\n",
      "\"Have you read Gaboriau's works?\" I asked. \"Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?\"\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \"Lecoq was a miserable bungler,\" he said, in an angry voice; \"he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a textbook for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\"\n",
      "I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window and stood looking out into the busy street. \"This fellow may be very clever,\" I said to myself, \"but he is certainly very conceited.\"\n",
      "\"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\" he said, querulously. \"What is the use of having brains in our profession? I know well that I have\n",
      "it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.\"\n",
      "I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic.\n",
      "\"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\" I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.\n",
      "\"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\"Brag and bounce!\" thought I to myself. \"He knows that I cannot verify his guess.\"\n",
      "The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.\n",
      "\"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.\n",
      "Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot. \"May I ask, my lad,\" I said, in the blandest voice, \"what your trade may be?\"\n",
      "\"Commissionaire, sir,\" he said, gruffly. \"Uniform away for repairs.\"\n",
      "\"And you were?\" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.\n",
      "\"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.\"\n",
      "He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in salute, and was gone.\n",
      "I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a prearranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him, he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\n",
      "\"How in the world did you deduce that?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"Deduce what?\" said he, petulantly.\n",
      "\"Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\"\n",
      "\"I have no time for trifles,\" he answered, brusquely; then with a smile, \"Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?\"\n",
      "\"No, indeed.\"\n",
      "\"It was easier to know it than to explain why I know it. If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\"\n",
      "\"Wonderful!\" I ejaculated.\n",
      "\"Commonplace,\" said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \"I said just now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!\" He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\n",
      "\"Why,\" I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \"this is terrible!\"\n",
      "\"It does seem to be a little out of the common,\" he remarked, calmly. \"Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\"\n",
      "This is the letter which I read to him,--\n",
      "\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:\n",
      "\"There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U. S. A.' There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything in statu quo until I hear from you. If you are unable to come, I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinions.\n",
      "\"Yours faithfully,\n",
      "\"TOBIAS GREGSON.\"\n",
      "\"Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" my friend remarked; \"he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too.\n",
      "They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent.\"\n",
      "I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \"Surely there is not a moment to be lost,\" I cried; \"shall I go and order you a cab?\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.\"\n",
      "\"Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\"\n",
      "\"My dear fellow, what does it matter to me? Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\"\n",
      "\"But he begs you to help him.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them, if I have nothing else. Come on!\"\n",
      "He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\n",
      "\"Get your hat,\" he said.\n",
      "\"You wish me to come?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\" A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\n",
      "It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the housetops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged depressed my spirits.\n",
      "\"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\" I said at last, interrupting Holmes's musical disquisition.\n",
      "\"No data yet,\" he answered. \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\"\n",
      "\"You will have your data soon,\" I remarked, pointing with my finger; \"this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.\"\n",
      "\"So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\" We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.\n",
      "Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \"To Let\" card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\n",
      "I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil; but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.\n",
      "At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion's hand with effusion. \"It is indeed kind of you to come,\" he said, \"I have had everything left untouched.\"\n",
      "\"Except that!\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \"If a herd of buffaloes had passed along, there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.\"\n",
      "\"I have had so much to do inside the house,\" the detective said evasively. \"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.\"\n",
      "Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \"With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,\" he said.\n",
      "Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \"I think we have done all that can be done,\" he answered; \"it's a queer case, though, and I knew your taste for such things.\"\n",
      "\"You did not come here in a cab?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\"Nor Lestrade?\"\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\"Then let us go and look at the room.\" With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment.\n",
      "A short passage, bare-planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\n",
      "It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull gray tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\n",
      "All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single, grim, motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant, sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad-shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short, stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked, as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and, as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw, gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark, grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.\n",
      "Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.\n",
      "\"This case will make a stir, sir,\" he remarked. \"It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.\"\n",
      "\"There is no clue?\" said Gregson.\n",
      "\"None at all,\" chimed in Lestrade.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \"You are sure that there is no wound?\" he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\n",
      "\"Positive!\" cried both detectives.\n",
      "\"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--presumably\n",
      "the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\"\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\"Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.\"\n",
      "As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.\n",
      "\"He has not been moved at all?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"No more than was necessary for the purpose of our examination.\"\n",
      "\"You can take him to the mortuary now,\" he said. \"There is nothing more to be learned.\"\n",
      "Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\n",
      "\"There's been a woman here,\" he cried. \"It's a woman's wedding ring.\"\n",
      "He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\n",
      "\"This complicates matters,\" said Gregson. \"Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before.\"\n",
      "\"You're sure it doesn't simplify them?\" observed Holmes. \"There's nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?\"\n",
      "\"We have it all here,\" said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \"A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather cardcase, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio's 'Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the flyleaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.\"\n",
      "\"At what address?\"\n",
      "\"American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both\n",
      "from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.\"\n",
      "\"Have you made any inquiries as to this man Stangerson?\"\n",
      "\"I did it at once, sir,\" said Gregson. \"I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet.\"\n",
      "\"Have you sent to Cleveland?\"\n",
      "\"We telegraphed this morning.\"\n",
      "\"How did you word your inquiries?\"\n",
      "\"We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.\"\n",
      "\"You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?\"\n",
      "\"I asked about Stangerson.\"\n",
      "\"Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\"\n",
      "\"I have said all I have to say,\" said Gregson, in an offended voice.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\"Mr. Gregson,\" he said, \"I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.\"\n",
      "The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.\n",
      "\"Come here,\" he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \"Now, stand there!\"\n",
      "He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\n",
      "\"Look at that!\" he said, triumphantly.\n",
      "I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word--\n",
      "RACHE\n",
      "\"What do you think of that?\" cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. \"This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.\"\n",
      "\"And what does it mean now that you have found it?\" asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice.\n",
      "\"Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up, you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It's all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\"\n",
      "\"I really beg your pardon!\" said my companion, who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \"You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night's mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\"\n",
      "As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded, well-trained foxhound, as it dashes backward and forward through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of gray dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\n",
      "\"They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" he remarked with a smile. \"It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.\"\n",
      "Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes's smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.\n",
      "\"What do you think of it, sir?\" they both asked.\n",
      "\"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I were to presume to help you,\" remarked my friend. \"You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\" There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \"If you will let me know how your investigations go,\" he continued, \"I shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?\"\n",
      "Lestrade glanced at his notebook. \"John Rance,\" he said. \"He is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\"\n",
      "Holmes took a note of the address.\n",
      "\"Come along, Doctor,\" he said: \"we shall go and look him up. I'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\" he continued, turning to the two detectives. \"There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore-leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.\"\n",
      "Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\n",
      "\"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\" asked the former.\n",
      "\"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \"One other thing, Lestrade,\" he added, turning round at the door: \"'Rache,' is the German for 'revenge'; so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\"\n",
      "With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open mouthed behind him.\n",
      "when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram.\n",
      "He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrad\n",
      "\"There is nothing like first-hand evidence,\" he remarked; \"as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.\"\n",
      "\"You amaze me, Holmes,\" said I. \"Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\"\n",
      "\"There's no room for a mistake,\" he answered. \"The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson's word for that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.\"\n",
      "\"That seems simple enough,\" said I; \"but how about the other man's height?\"\n",
      "\"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write above the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child's play.\"\n",
      "\"And his age?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"Well, if a man can stride four and a half feet without the smallest effort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\"\n",
      "\"The finger-nails and the Trichinopoly,\" I suggested.\n",
      "\"The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flaky --such an ash is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\"\n",
      "\"And the florid face?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\"\n",
      "I passed my hand over my brow. \"My head is in a whirl,\" I remarked; \"the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman's ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.\"\n",
      "My companion smiled approvingly.\n",
      "\"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\" he said. \"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade's discovery, it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjurer gets no credit when once he has explained his trick; and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\"\n",
      "\"I shall never do that,\" I answered; \"you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\"\n",
      "My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\n",
      "\"I'll tell you one other thing,\" he said. \"Patent-leathers and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside, they walked\n",
      "up and down the room--or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I've told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\"\n",
      "This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary byways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. \"That's Audley Court in there,\" he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \"You'll find me here when you come back.\"\n",
      "Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On inquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\n",
      "He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. \"I made my report at the office,\" he said.\n",
      "Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. \"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\" the constable answered, with his eyes upon the little golden disc.\n",
      "\"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\"\n",
      "Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows, as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative.\n",
      "\"I'll tell it ye from the beginning,\" he said. \"My time is from ten at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the White Hart; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove beat--and we stood\n",
      "together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin'. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take a look round and see that all\n",
      "was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a-strollin' down, thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won't have the drains seed to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap, therefore, at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door-- --\"\n",
      "\"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\" my companion interrupted. \"What did you do that for?\"\n",
      "Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features.\n",
      "\"Why, that's true, sir,\" he said; \"though how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see when I got up to the door, it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for someone with me. I ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but there wasn't no sign of him nor of anyone else.\"\n",
      "\"There was no one in the street?\"\n",
      "\"Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. There was a candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I saw-- --\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then-- --\"\n",
      "John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes. \"Where was you hid to see all that?\" he cried. \"It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should.\"\n",
      "Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\n",
      "\"Don't go arresting me for the murder,\" he said. \"I am one of the hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did you do next?\"\n",
      "Rance resumed his seat, without, however, losing his mystified expression. \"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.\"\n",
      "\"Was the street empty then?\"\n",
      "\"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\"\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "The constable's features broadened into a grin. \"I've seen many a drunk chap in my time,\" he said, \"but never anyone so cryin' drunk as that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up ag'in the railings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about Columbine's New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn't stand, far less help.\"\n",
      "\"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \"He was an uncommon drunk sort o' man,\" he said. \"He'd ha' found hisself in the station if we hadn't been so took up.\"\n",
      "\"His face--his dress--didn't you notice them?\" Holmes broke in impatiently.\n",
      "\"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up--me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round-- --\"\n",
      "\"That will do,\" cried Holmes. \"What became of him?\"\n",
      "\"We'd enough to do without lookin' after him,\" the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice. \"I'll wager he found his way home all right.\"\n",
      "\"How was he dressed?\"\n",
      "\"A brown overcoat.\"\n",
      "\"Had he a whip in his hand?\"\n",
      "\"A whip--no.\"\n",
      "\"He must have left it behind,\" muttered my companion. \"You didn't happen to see or hear a cab after that?\"\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\"There's a half-sovereign for you,\" my companion said, standing up and taking his hat. \"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your sergeant's stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\"\n",
      "We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.\n",
      "\"The blundering fool!\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings. \"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it.\"\n",
      "\"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way of criminals.\"\n",
      "\"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I shall have him, Doctor--I'll lay you two to one that I have him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why shouldn't we use a little art jargon. There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are splendid. What's that little thing of Chopin's she plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\"\n",
      "Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\n",
      "More than once they lost their way, but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.\n",
      "As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \"They will be upon our track by this time,\" he said. \"Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson, we may rest for the remainder of our lives.\"\n",
      "During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there, huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\n",
      "About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bid Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back, he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the background. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.\n",
      "He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though, from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.\n",
      "The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.\n",
      "He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary, silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onward frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\n",
      "When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.\n",
      "Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\n",
      "JOHN FERRIER,\n",
      "FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY.\n",
      "Died August 4th, 1860.\n",
      "The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of an Elder's son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.\n",
      "Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end.\n",
      "With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the Avenging Angels.\n",
      "For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Canon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the Saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.\n",
      "\"I am Jefferson Hope,\" he said. \"You remember me.\"\n",
      "The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last satisfied himself as to his identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation.\n",
      "\"You are mad to come here,\" he cried. \"It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\"\n",
      "\"I don't fear them, or their warrant,\" Hope said, earnestly. \"You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God's sake, don't refuse to answer me.\"\n",
      "\"What is it?\" the Mormon asked, uneasily. \"Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes.\"\n",
      "\"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?\"\n",
      "\"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up; you have no life left in you.\"\n",
      "\"Don't mind me,\" said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \"Married, you say?\"\n",
      "\"Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I am off,\" said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\"\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.\n",
      "The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding ring from her finger. \"She shall not be buried in that,\" he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.\n",
      "For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange, wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\n",
      "Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things, practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.\n",
      "His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts.\n",
      "Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object to which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated it was only to find that Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\n",
      "Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg, they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there, he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.\n",
      " Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whisky and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.\n",
      "\"Stangerson too!\" he muttered. \"The plot thickens.\"\n",
      "\"It was quite thick enough before,\" grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. \"I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\"\n",
      "\"Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\" stammered Gregson.\n",
      "\"I have just come from his room,\" said Lestrade. \"I was the first to discover what had occurred.\"\n",
      "\"We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,\" Holmes observed. \"Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\"\n",
      "\"I have no objection,\" Lestrade answered, seating himself. \"I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the 3rd. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8:30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.\"\n",
      "\"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\" remarked Holmes.\n",
      "\"So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making inquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my inquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.\n",
      "\"'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,' they said. 'He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.'\n",
      "\"'Where is he now?' I asked.\n",
      "\"'He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.'\n",
      "\"'I will go up and see him at once,' I said.\n",
      "\"It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years' experience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\"\n",
      "I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.\n",
      "\"The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\" he said.\n",
      "\"That was it,\" said Lestrade, in an awestruck voice; and we were all silent for a while.\n",
      "There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle, tingled as I thought of it.\n",
      "\"The man was seen,\" continued Lestrade. \"A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\"\n",
      "I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.\n",
      "\"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty-odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.' There was no name appended to this message.\"\n",
      "\"And there was nothing else?\" Holmes asked.\n",
      "\"Nothing of any importance. The man's novel, with which he had read himself to sleep, was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\"\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\n",
      "\"The last link,\" he cried, exultantly. \"My case is complete.\"\n",
      "The two detectives stared at him in amazement.\n",
      "\"I have now in my hands,\" my companion said, confidently, \"all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?\"\n",
      "\"I have them,\" said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \"I took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the police station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.\"\n",
      "\"Give them here,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Doctor,\" turning to me, \"are those ordinary pills?\"\n",
      "They certainly were not. They were of a pearly gray colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light. \"From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"Precisely so,\" answered Holmes. \"Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday?\"\n",
      "I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.\n",
      "\"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. \"One half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wineglass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\"\n",
      "\"This may be very interesting,\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at; \"I cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\"\n",
      "\"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.\"\n",
      "As he spoke he turned the contents of the wineglass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes's earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.\n",
      "Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.\n",
      "\"It can't be a coincidence,\" he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \"it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\" With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \"I should have more faith,\" he said; \"I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box, one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\"\n",
      "This last statement appeared to me to be so startling that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\n",
      "\"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious, because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outre and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it?\"\n",
      "\"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked Lestrade. \"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\"\n",
      "\"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"\n",
      "Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\n",
      "\"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail, I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\"\n",
      "Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\n",
      "\"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab downstairs.\"\n",
      "\"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don't you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.\"\n",
      "\"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only find the man to put them on.\"\n",
      "\"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"\n",
      "I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.\n",
      "\"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling over his task, and never turning his head.\n",
      "The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\n",
      "\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.\"\n",
      "The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes's triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman's dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.\n",
      "\"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\" he continued, with a pleasant smile, \"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.\"\n",
      "central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilization. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged canons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are gray with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\n",
      "There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\n",
      "In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, gray earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing silence.\n",
      "It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\n",
      "Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger and from thirst.\n",
      "He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild, questioning eyes, and then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \"Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence?\" he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\n",
      "Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a gray shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the gray parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled dimpled fists.\n",
      "\"You've hurt me!\" said a childish voice, reproachfully.\n",
      "\"Have I, though?\" the man answered penitently; \"I didn't go for to do it.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the gray shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron, all bespoke a mother's care. The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.\n",
      "\"How is it now?\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the tousy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\n",
      "\"Kiss it and make it well,\" she said, with perfect gravity, showing the injured part up to him. \"That's what mother used to do. Where's mother?\"\n",
      "\"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.\"\n",
      "\"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to auntie's for tea, and now she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't there no water nor nothing to eat?\"\n",
      "\"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up ag'in me like that, and then you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie. What's that you've got?\"\n",
      "\"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to home I'll give them to brother Bob.\"\n",
      "\"You'll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man confidently.\n",
      "\"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember when we left the river?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes.\"\n",
      "\"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But there was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you, and--and-- --\"\n",
      "\"And you couldn't wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy visage.\n",
      "\"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.\"\n",
      "\"Then mother's a deader too,\" cried the little girl, dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\n",
      "\"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\n",
      "\"I guess that's about the size of it.\"\n",
      "\"Why didn't you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, you will, dearie.\"\n",
      "\"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long will it be first?\"\n",
      "\"I don't know--not very long.\" The man's eyes were fixed upon the\n",
      "northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the West, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\n",
      "\"Cocks and hens,\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \"Say, did God make this country?\"\n",
      "\"Of course He did,\" said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question.\n",
      "\"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\" the little girl continued. \"I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.\"\n",
      "\"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\" the man asked diffidently.\n",
      "\"It ain't night yet,\" she answered.\n",
      "\"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the wagon when we was on the plains.\"\n",
      "\"Why don't you say some yourself?\" the child asked, with wondering eyes.\n",
      "\"I disremember them,\" he answered. \"I hain't said none since I was half the height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out, and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.\"\n",
      "\"Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,\" she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. \"You've got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind of good.\"\n",
      "It was a strange sight, had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread Being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\n",
      "Had the wanderer remained awake for another half-hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds.\n",
      "As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of wagons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, wagons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the wagons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\n",
      "At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave, iron-faced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.\n",
      "\"The wells are to the right, my brothers,\" said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\n",
      "\"To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\"\n",
      "said another.\n",
      "\"Fear not for water,\" cried a third. \"He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\"\n",
      "\"Amen! amen!\" responded the whole party.\n",
      "They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the gray rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word \"Redskins\" was on every lip.\n",
      "\"There can't be any number of Injuns here,\" said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. \"We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\"\n",
      "\"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson?\" asked one of the band.\n",
      "\"And I,\" \"And I,\" cried a dozen voices.\n",
      "\"Leave your horses below and we will await you here,\" the elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the sky-line. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes.\n",
      "On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden-haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs, terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the newcomers, uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.\n",
      "The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers, who stared about them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his bony hand over his eyes. \"This is what they call delirium, I guess,\" he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing, but looked all round her with the wondering, questioning gaze of childhood.\n",
      "The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the wagons.\n",
      "\"My name is John Ferrier,\" the wanderer explained; \"me and that little un are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south.\"\n",
      "\"Is she your child?\" asked someone.\n",
      "\"I guess she is now,\" the other cried, defiantly; \"she's mine 'cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?\" he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \"there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.\"\n",
      "\"Nigh unto ten thousand,\" said one of the young men; \"we are the persecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Moroni.\"\n",
      "\"I never heard tell on him,\" said the wanderer. \"He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.\"\n",
      "\"Do not jest at that which is sacred,\" said the other, sternly. \"We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the state of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.\"\n",
      "The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \"I see,\" he said; \"you are the Mormons.\"\n",
      "\"We are the Mormons,\" answered his companions with one voice.\n",
      "\"And where are you going?\"\n",
      "\"We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.\"\n",
      "They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced, meek-looking women; strong, laughing children; and anxious, earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a wagon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four apiece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways.\n",
      "\"If we take you with us,\" he said, in solemn words, \"it can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\"\n",
      "\"Guess I'll come with you on any terms,\" said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression.\n",
      "\"Take him, Brother Stangerson,\" he said, \"give him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\"\n",
      "\"On, on to Zion!\" cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great wagons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed led them to his wagon, where a meal was already awaiting them.\n",
      "\"You shall remain here,\" he said. \"In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and forever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\"\n",
      "John Ferrier's heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints.\n",
      "Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the secret societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of Utah.\n",
      "Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\n",
      "At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about --rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and recorroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\n",
      "Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart.\n",
      "One fine morning John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded him little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.\n",
      "\"Brother Ferrier,\" he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \"the true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?\"\n",
      "\"It is so,\" answered John Ferrier.\n",
      "\"In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.\"\n",
      "\"And how have I neglected it?\" asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation. \"Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not-- --?\"\n",
      "\"Where are your wives?\" asked Young, looking round him. \"Call them in, that I may greet them.\"\n",
      "\"It is true that I have not married,\" Ferrier answered. \"But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\"\n",
      "\"It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\" said the leader of the Mormons. \"She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\"\n",
      "John Ferrier groaned internally.\n",
      "\"There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? 'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.' This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.\"\n",
      "John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip.\n",
      "\"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed gray hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers, [1] but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to his house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that?\"\n",
      "Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\n",
      "\"You will give us time,\" he said at last. \"My daughter is very young--she is scarce of an age to marry.\"\n",
      "\"She shall have a month to choose,\" said Young, rising from his seat. \"At the end of that time she shall give her answer.\"\n",
      "He was passing through the door, when he turned with flushed face and flashing eyes. \"It were better for you, John Ferrier,\" he thundered, \"that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!\"\n",
      "With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy steps scrunching along the shingly path.\n",
      "He was still sitting with his elbow upon his knee, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter, when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\n",
      "\"I could not help it,\" she said, in answer to his look. \"His voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\"\n",
      "\"Don't you scare yourself,\" he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \"We'll fix it up somehow or another. You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap, do you?\"\n",
      "A sob and a squeeze of his hand were her only answer.\n",
      "\"No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. He's a likely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folks here, in spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\"\n",
      "Lucy laughed through her tears at her father's description.\n",
      "\"When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about those\n",
      "who oppose the Prophet; something terrible always happens to them.\"\n",
      "\"But we haven't opposed him yet,\" her father answered. \"It will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\"\n",
      "\"Leave Utah!\"\n",
      "\"That's about the size of it.\"\n",
      "\"But the farm?\"\n",
      "\"We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. I don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned Prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to me. Guess I'm too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.\"\n",
      "\"But they won't let us leave,\" his daughter objected.\n",
      "\"Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. In the meantime, don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes swelled up, else he'll be walking into me when he sees you. There's nothing to be afeared about, and there's no danger at all.\"\n",
      "John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shot-gun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\n",
      " A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.\n",
      "\"Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\" Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening. \"Where will their grand advertisement be now?\"\n",
      "\"I don't see that they had very much to do with his capture,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\" returned my companion, bitterly. \"The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done? Never mind,\" he continued, more brightly, after a pause. \"I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.\"\n",
      "\"Simple!\" I ejaculated.\n",
      "\"Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\" said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. \"The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\"\n",
      "\"That is true,\" said I.\n",
      "\"I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forward, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\"\n",
      "\"I confess,\" said I, \"that I do not quite follow you.\"\n",
      "\"I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backward, or analytically.\"\n",
      "\"I understand,\" said I.\n",
      "\"Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham.\n",
      "\"This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.\n",
      "\"On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man's person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man's lips, I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard-of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\n",
      "\"And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall, I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had inquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber's former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.\n",
      "\"I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer's nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\n",
      "\"Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my inquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.\n",
      "\"I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver? All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.\n",
      "\"If he had been one, there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see, the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.\"\n",
      "\"It is wonderful!\" I cried. \"Your merits should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won't, I will for you.\"\n",
      "\"You may do what you like, Doctor,\" he answered. \"See here!\" he continued, handing a paper over to me, \"look at this!\"\n",
      "It was the Echo for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question.\n",
      "\"The public,\" it said, \"have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old-standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.\"\n",
      "\"Didn't I tell you so when we started?\" cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. \"That's the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!\"\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" I answered; \"I have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser--\n",
      "\"Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\n",
      "Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplar in arca.\"\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.\n",
      "Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.\n",
      "Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.\n",
      "\"Which is it to-day?\" I asked,--\"morphine or cocaine?\"\n",
      "He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened. \"It is cocaine,\" he said,--\"a seven-per-cent. solution. Would you care to try it?\"\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" I answered, brusquely. \"My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.\"\n",
      "He smiled at my vehemence. \"Perhaps you are right, Watson,\" he said. \"I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment.\"\n",
      "\"But consider!\" I said, earnestly. \"Count the cost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable.\"\n",
      "He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish for conversation.\n",
      "\"My mind,\" he said, \"rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.\"\n",
      "\"The only unofficial detective?\" I said, raising my eyebrows.\n",
      "\"The only unofficial consulting detective,\" he answered. \"I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths--which, by the way, is their normal state--the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" said I, cordially. \"I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.'\"\n",
      "He shook his head sadly. \"I glanced over it,\" said he. \"Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.\"\n",
      "\"But the romance was there,\" I remonstrated. \"I could not tamper with the facts.\"\n",
      "\"Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.\"\n",
      "I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.\n",
      "\"My practice has extended recently to the Continent,\" said Holmes, after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. \"I was consulted last week by Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance.\" He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray \"magnifiques,\" \"coup-de-maitres,\" and \"tours-de-force,\" all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.\n",
      "\"He speaks as a pupil to his master,\" said I.\n",
      "\"Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,\" said Sherlock Holmes, lightly. \"He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and that may come in time. He is now translating my small works into French.\"\n",
      "\"Your works?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, didn't you know?\" he cried, laughing. \"Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for example, is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes.' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.\"\n",
      "\"You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective,--especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.\"\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" I answered, earnestly. \"It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.\"\n",
      "\"Why, hardly,\" he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. \"For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.\"\n",
      "\"Right!\" said I. \"Right on both points! But I confess that I don't see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.\"\n",
      "\"It is simplicity itself,\" he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,--\"so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighborhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.\"\n",
      "\"How, then, did you deduce the telegram?\"\n",
      "\"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.\"\n",
      "\"In this case it certainly is so,\" I replied, after a little thought. \"The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\"\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.\"\n",
      "\"I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?\"\n",
      "I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.\n",
      "\"There are hardly any data,\" he remarked. \"The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\"\n",
      "\"You are right,\" I answered. \"It was cleaned before being sent to me.\" In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?\n",
      "\"Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\" he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. \"Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\"\n",
      "\"That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\"\n",
      "\"Right, so far,\" said I. \"Anything else?\"\n",
      "\"He was a man of untidy habits,--very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.\"\n",
      "I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.\n",
      "\"This is unworthy of you, Holmes,\" I said. \"I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\"\n",
      "\"My dear doctor,\" said he, kindly, \"pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\"\n",
      "\"Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\"\n",
      "\"But it was not mere guess-work?\"\n",
      "\"No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,--destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.\"\n",
      "I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.\n",
      "\"It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference,--that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference,--that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole,--marks where the key has slipped. What sober man's key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?\"\n",
      "\"It is as clear as daylight,\" I answered. \"I regret the injustice which I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?\"\n",
      "\"None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-colored houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.\"\n",
      "I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.\n",
      "\"A young lady for you, sir,\" she said, addressing my companion.\n",
      "\"Miss Mary Morstan,\" he read. \"Hum! I have no recollection of the name. Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don't go, doctor. I should prefer that you remain.\"\n",
      "Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.\n",
      "\"I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\"\n",
      "\"Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\" he repeated thoughtfully. \"I believe that I was of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one.\"\n",
      "\"She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself.\"\n",
      "Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut, hawklike features. \"State your case,\" said he, in brisk, business tones.\n",
      "I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. \"You will, I am sure, excuse me,\" I said, rising from my chair.\n",
      "To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me. \"If your friend,\" she said, \"would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.\"\n",
      "I relapsed into my chair.\n",
      "\"Briefly,\" she continued, \"the facts are these. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve months' leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home with his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead--\" She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence.\n",
      "\"The date?\" asked Holmes, opening his note-book.\n",
      "\"He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,--nearly ten years ago.\"\n",
      "\"His luggage?\"\n",
      "\"Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,--some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there.\"\n",
      "\"Had he any friends in town?\"\n",
      "\"Only one that we know of,--Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England.\"\n",
      "\"A singular case,\" remarked Holmes.\n",
      "\"I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six years ago--to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882--an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was no name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column. The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome.\" She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.\n",
      "\"Your statement is most interesting,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"Has anything else occurred to you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Holmes. \"The envelope too, please. Postmark, London, S.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man's thumb-mark on corner,--probably postman. Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in his stationery. No address. 'Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock. If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.' Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\"\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I want to ask you.\"\n",
      "\"Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before.\"\n",
      "\"But would he come?\" she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.\n",
      "\"I should be proud and happy,\" said I, fervently, \"if I can be of any service.\"\n",
      "\"You are both very kind,\" she answered. \"I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\"You must not be later,\" said Holmes. \"There is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?\"\n",
      "\"I have them here,\" she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper.\n",
      "\"You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now.\" He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little darting glances from one to the other. \"They are disguised hands, except the letter,\" he said, presently, \"but there can be no question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\"\n",
      "\"Nothing could be more unlike.\"\n",
      "\"I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.\"\n",
      "\"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd.\n",
      "\"What a very attractive woman!\" I exclaimed, turning to my companion.\n",
      "He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. \"Is she?\" he said, languidly. \"I did not observe.\"\n",
      "\"You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!\" I cried. \"There is something positively inhuman in you at times.\"\n",
      "He smiled gently. \"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\"\n",
      "\"In this case, however\"\n",
      "\"I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow's scribble?\"\n",
      "\"It is legible and regular,\" I answered. \"A man of business habits and some force of character.\"\n",
      "Holmes shook his head. \"Look at his long letters,\" he said. \"They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.' I shall be back in an hour.\"\n",
      "I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor,--her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,--nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination.\n",
      "It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.\n",
      "\"There is no great mystery in this matter,\" he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him. \"The facts appear to admit of only one explanation.\"\n",
      "\"What! you have solved it already?\"\n",
      "\"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, VERY suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\"\n",
      "\"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\"\n",
      "\"No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?\"\n",
      "\"But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.\"\n",
      "\"There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\" said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \"But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.\"\n",
      "I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one.\n",
      "Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.\n",
      "\"Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,\" she said. \"His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one could understand. I don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.\"\n",
      "Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens. \"It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remarked. \"It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, 'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\"\n",
      "\"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\"\n",
      "\"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.\" He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.\n",
      "It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.\n",
      "At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.\n",
      "\"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she.\n",
      "He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. \"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.\"\n",
      "\"I give you my word on that,\" she answered.\n",
      "He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.\n",
      "The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets.\n",
      "\"Rochester Row,\" said he. \"Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.\"\n",
      "We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.\n",
      "\"Wordsworth Road,\" said my companion. \"Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\"\n",
      "We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings, the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.\n",
      "\"The Sahib awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. \"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\" it cried. \"Show them straight in to me.\"\n",
